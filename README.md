## About
正在用项目使用vue3 + go 开发数据库客户端，目前只准备做桌面端，会兼容window、macox、linux，由于我有正常的工作，都是在晚上跟周末开发。

[使用 Go + HTML + CSS + JS 构建漂亮的跨平台桌面应用](https://wails.io/zh-Hans/#)

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. In another terminal, go into the `frontend`
directory and run `npm run dev`. The frontend dev server will run on http://localhost:34115. Connect to this in your
browser and connect to your application.

## Building
To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.

> It's designed to be simple to use and effective, when working with more databases simultaneously.
But there are also many advanced features like schema compare, visual query designer, chart visualisation or batch export and import.
